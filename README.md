`SurrogateSeq` is an `R` package to implement group sequential procedures that allow for early stopping to declare efficacy using a surrogate marker and the possibility of futility stopping.   

More details on the method are available in Parast L and Bartroﬀ J (2024). Group Sequential Testing of a Treatment Eﬀect Using a
Surrogate Marker. Biometrics, 80(4): ujae108. [doi:10.1093/biomtc/ujae108](https://doi:10.1093/biomtc/ujae108).
